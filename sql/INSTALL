To install the database, run the install.sh script. It takes two parameters:

  install.sh ATLAS_CONNECTION [ATLAS_INDEX_TABLESPACE]

ATLAS_CONNECTION - Oracle connection (userid/password@SID)
ATLAS_INDEX_TABLES - Optional parameter, if you want indexes to reside in a different tablespace.

Do not forget to unpack and install the NetCDFs into a dedicated directory.
