The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization. To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner, we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human &lt;em&gt;prostate&lt;/em&gt; epithelial cells (HPECs) passaged to senescence. These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein. Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative, differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components. A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes: the chemokine BRAK, DOC1, and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis, IGFBP-3. Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human &lt;em&gt;prostate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cancer&lt;/em&gt; cell lines and xenografts, and previously, their inactivation was documented in tumor samples. Thus, these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization. These changes may be critical not only in allowing cells to bypass senescence in vitro but in the progression of &lt;em&gt;prostate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cancer&lt;/em&gt; in vivo.</description><description><id>1341914677</id>(Generated description) Experiment with 12 hybridizations, using 24 samples of species [Homo sapiens], using 12 arrays of array design [SMD Homo sapiens Array SHAS, 41088 features, SMD Homo sapiens Array SHBH, 45312 features], producing 12 raw data files and 12 transformed and/or normalized data files.</description></experiment></experiments>
