Classes for parsing, handling and loading data from MAGE-TAB IDF and SDRF files.
These files can be parsed and handled by classes in the handler package, which
produces an in-memory datamodel of the IDF/SDRF datastructure. The specification
and classes for this structure are present in the datamodel package.

The parser framework is extensible - it is possible to extend handlers to
support writing functionality. By replacing provided handlers with your own
handlers that override the writeValues() methods, you can incorporate writing
code directly into the parser, adapting the internal object model into any other
object model you want to support. In this way, the parser can function as an
"adapter" between generally MAGE-compliant datastructures.
