<body>
SDRF specific handler classes. This package contains an interface and an
abstract implementation of an SDRF handler, with specialisations of a handler
that are relevant only to SDRF type handlers. It also contains the node package
for all known implementations of SDRF-type handlers, for handling any nodes (or
attributes on those nodes) that can be defined in the datastructure given by the
MAGE-TAB specification.
