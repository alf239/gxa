</head>
<body>
Handler classes, interfaces and utilities for interpreting MAGE-TAB documents
and converting to objects in the datamodel and ArrayExpress 2 domain model. This
package is split between the idf and sdrf sub-packages, which contain handlers
for each type of data in these files. This package also contains an abstract
handler implementation, defining common functionality like status updates and
common modes of operation (for example: read; write; validate). This package
also contains an enum for defining the mode of operation of a handler, and a
pool for interacting with and obtaining handlers, making the process of
acquiring a handler easier and ensuring handlers can be reused after a given
handler task.
